One of the most important questions that followed from Ramón y Cajal's work concerned the nature of the message that crossed the synapse from the presynaptic neuron (the neuron before the synapse) to the postsynaptic neuron (recipient neuron). From the time of Galvani it was known that neurons contained electrical energy; but how did this principle extend to synapses? For example, did an electrical current jump across the tiny synaptic gap, or was there another form of communication? As early as 1877 it had been suggested by the German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond that chemical transmission might be the answer. And, in 1904, the Cambridge student Thomas Eliot lent support to this idea by showing that adrenaline stimulated the activity of bodily organs that were innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. In-deed, Eliot made what is now regarded as the first clear statement about the feasibility of neurotransmission: 'Adrenaline might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.' But, arguably, the single most important experiment that proved chemical transmission was performed by Otto Loewi in 1921. According to Loewi's memoirs, on the night of Easter Saturday 1921, he awoke from a sleep and wrote down the details of an experiment that had come to him in a dream. Unfortunately, Loewi went back to sleep, and on waking again, was unable to decipher his notes. The next night he awoke at 3 A.M. with the idea back in his mind, and this time he cycled to his laboratory to perform the experiment. Two hours later, the chemical nature of synaptic transmission had in essence been proved (Finger 1994).

In his experiment, Loewi used frog hearts, which are similar to our own in that they are supplied by two different peripheral nerves: the sympathetic branch that excites the heart and makes it beat more rapidly, and the parasympathetic branch (also called the vagus nerve) which slows it down. Loewi used two hearts: one with the sympathetic and vagus nerve intact, and the other with nerves removed (see Figure 1.4). He then placed the intact heart in a fluid bath and stimulated its vagus nerve causing its beat to slow down. Loewi collected the fluid surrounding this heart and applied it to the sec ond one - and found that its intrinsic beat also began to decrease. The results indicated that the fluid must contain a substance that had been secreted by the previously stimulated vagus nerve projecting to the heart. Later analysis by Sir Henry Dale and his colleagues showed this chemical to be acetylcholine, which is an important neurotransmitter in the peripheral and central nervous systems.

It is now known that most nerve cells in the body communicate with each other by secreting neurotransmitters into synapses (see Figure 1.5). The series of events that produce this transmission can be described simply as follows. (1) The axon terminals of the presynaptic neuron receive an electrical impulse called an action potential, and in response they secrete a neurotransmitter. (2) This chemical diffuses into and across the synapse and binds to specialised sites on the postsynaptic neuron called receptors.
